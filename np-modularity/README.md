# np-modularity

This checks one thing: when something changes on the network side — the shape data has to be sent in, or the rules that shape has to follow — does the seller's own code have to change too? Or can it stay exactly the same?

Inside a seller's system there are three parts: their own data, something in the middle that turns that data into the shape the network expects, and the rules that shape has to follow. When the rules change, only the middle part should need to change. The seller's own data and code should never have to.

## Getting the seller's real data

`fetch-shopify-data.js` pulls every product from the real Shopify store, exactly as Shopify returns it. Saved to `data/shopify-raw-products.json`.

```bash
npm install
node fetch-shopify-data.js
```

Needs `SHOPIFY_SHOP` and `SHOPIFY_ADMIN_API_TOKEN` in `.env` (see `.env.example`). `data/` is not committed — it's real store data, regenerate it locally instead.
